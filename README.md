Scripts and assets for a game I'm making in unity, take two

Plan is to make Rocket League but players punch a giant frisbee with blades around to score goals and kill eachother.

Current Plan:
1. Get Slicer/Goals to work (scripts)
2. Get movement feeling good (tweak values)
3. Multiplayer (if that's even possible on my laptop, gonna take a while)
